# ShardLoom Phased Execution Plan

## How To Maintain This File

- Keep actionable working items in `## Planned`.
- Keep detailed completed session blocks in
  `docs/architecture/phased-execution-completed-ledger.md`; do not place completed narrative here.
- Keep Planned ordered by current dependency and user value, not numeric CG order.
- Do not keep a separate Active section. The next autonomous work is the first unchecked Planned
  checkbox after this file has been reordered.
- Use one unchecked checkbox per active item or child slice. Put acceptance detail in nested plain
  bullets, not additional unchecked boxes, so release/completion gates report the real open-item
  count.
- Move a completed item summary to the completed ledger after merge or session completion.
- Do not duplicate "current" status in multiple places.
- Do not use stale percentage estimates.
- CG-1 through CG-23 remain competitive gates, not replacement phase IDs.
- External engines are baselines only, never fallback execution.
- For RFC-level phase mapping details, use `docs/architecture/rfc-phase-traceability.md`.

## Planned Item Detail Standard

Every unchecked Planned item must be executable by an autonomous Codex session without guessing.

Each item should name:

- Source: governing RFC, architecture doc, benchmark report, issue, PR, or review finding.
- Current state: what exists today and what is still unsupported, diagnostic-only, or report-only.
- Next outcome: the concrete result expected from the next cohesive PR/session.
- User-visible surface: CLI, Python, benchmark, docs, API, capability view, evidence artifact, or
  release gate.
- Implementation scope: files, modules, commands, and generated artifacts expected to change.
- Evidence required: correctness, benchmark, execution-certificate, Native I/O, materialization,
  decode, policy, no-fallback, release, security, or website evidence as applicable.
- Acceptance: observable conditions that make the item done.
- Verification: exact tests, validators, benchmark reruns, snapshots, or build commands expected.
- Non-goals: what must not be implemented in the slice.
- Claim boundary: what can and cannot be claimed after completion.
- Fallback boundary: expected `fallback_attempted=false` and `external_engine_invoked=false`
  behavior.
- Ledger rule: completed detail moves to
  `docs/architecture/phased-execution-completed-ledger.md`.

Do not leave planned work as a bare statement such as "`<thing>` remains incomplete." Convert broad
items into evidence-bearing implementation slices. Split a Planned item only when one coherent
reviewable PR/session would be unsafe, blocked by an external dependency, or too broad to validate.

A Planned item may be checked off only when implementation or deterministic unsupported diagnostics
exist, tests or validators exist, evidence refs are attached where claims are made, unsupported
paths remain explicit, no fallback engine was invoked, completed details are moved to the ledger,
and supporting docs are updated without becoming a second active queue.

Section-completion rule:

- Prefer one substantial PR/session that completes an entire runtime section over tiny row, format,
  or operator slivers.
- Split only for concrete safety, dependency, generated-artifact, or verification boundaries.
- For a section-completion PR, derive the full checklist from the owning item, companion runtime
  equivalent, status/capability files, route taxonomy, tests, and user-visible surfaces before
  editing.
- Avoid wording such as "promote one format/operator at a time" unless that format or operator has a
  separate dependency or deterministic blocker.

No item may create or imply a public claim unless it explicitly lists the evidence that supports the
claim. Performance, superiority, Spark-displacement, production, SQL/DataFrame, object-store,
Foundry, REST, live/hybrid, and package-release claims require workload-scoped evidence and release
gates. If evidence is missing, the item must say `claim_gate_status=not_claim_grade` or
`support_status=unsupported|blocked|report_only`.

Status reading order:

1. Planned: next work in logical implementation order.
2. Completed ledger: recently finished sessions first, then historical provenance ledgers in
   `docs/architecture/phased-execution-completed-ledger.md`.
3. Competitive Engine Gate detailed checklists: attribution detail only; promote new actionable work
   into Planned before implementation.

## Architecture Document Ownership

- This file is the mutable source of truth for planned sequence, deferred work, and CG closeout
  ordering.
- `docs/architecture/phased-execution-completed-ledger.md` is the mutable source of truth for
  detailed session history and historical phase ledgers.
- `docs/architecture/global-architecture-review.md` may carry global audit rows, but actionable
  implementation must be promoted here before execution.
- Supporting docs may contain rationale, inventories, traceability, and historical notes, but they
  must not introduce a second current queue.
- Repeated support, claim-boundary, benchmark-interpretation, and runtime-state explanations should
  be owned by one canonical doc or generated data artifact; other pages should link to or render
  that source instead of restating parallel wording.

Reference-doc rule: these files are evidence, guardrails, or inventories. They do not authorize
runtime behavior, support claims, dependency expansion, package publication, external effects, or
fallback execution unless a matching unchecked item below is completed with evidence and moved to
the ledger.

## Planned

Use this section for the next implementation sequence. Keep it ordered by dependency and user value.
The first unchecked checkbox is the next default autonomous slice.

Current autonomous execution order:

### Open Work Checklist

No autonomous implementation items are open in this file. New audit, optimization, runtime, docs,
website, release, or packaging work must be promoted here as a concrete unchecked item before
editing behavior.

### Remaining work snapshot

| Status | Work | Next decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Closed | `RELEASE-PACKAGE-15` | Completed in the ledger with clean-source benchmark publication evidence for source revision `74a2e7d4f77eed0686971518e010463da26f2cdf`; no autonomous implementation item remains. |
| Historical | PR #1174 benchmark row/readiness context, repo-wide audit closeout, release-sequence closeout, and completed benchmark/profile, sub-evidence, user-surface proof | Preserved in `docs/architecture/phased-execution-completed-ledger.md`; do not treat as active work. |
| Mapped, not autonomous queue | Unchecked global architecture review rows | Governed by `docs/architecture/global-architecture-review.md` and `docs/architecture/runtime-gap-family-burn-down.md`; promote concrete implementation items here before work begins. |
| Deferred approval/artifact gate | Public release/package approval | Clean local Conda proof, dependency/security/package local-gate evidence, and current benchmark-publication evidence now pass locally; remaining blockers are package-channel approval/proof, publication/API/schema stability approval, and per-claim evidence promotion before any public claim. |

Deferred Non-Runtime Closeout Queue: closed for the current cleanup batch. Completed non-runtime history
lives in `docs/architecture/phased-execution-completed-ledger.md`; any future work from manual
review must be promoted here as a concrete unchecked item before editing behavior.

### Evidence Pointers

- Current benchmark timing snapshot and PR #1174 route/readiness context are preserved in the
  completed ledger entry `Phase-plan open-queue cleanup and completed-state ledger migration`.
- Performance route, stage, and timing-surface contracts live in
  `docs/architecture/performance-attribution-and-execution-structure.md`.
- Current source/input evidence contracts live in `docs/architecture/universal-input-contract.md`.
- Benchmark artifacts are evidence and optimization direction only:
  `performance_claim_allowed=false`, no Spark-displacement/superiority claim, no package-release
  claim, and no public freshness claim until a clean-source artifact is regenerated from the source
  revision being claimed.

### Reopen Policy

- Completed `PERF-DESIGN-*` items may return to Planned only as explicit `*R` optimization passes
  when current benchmark rows, validator output, or targeted local simulation identify a measured
  bottleneck.
- A reopened `*R` item must preserve the original closeout contract and add a narrower optimization
  contract: control surface, timing rows/fields proving it is still worth changing, fail-closed
  blocker vocabulary, and benchmark/test evidence.
- Use dynamic admission for repeated dependency/source decisions, PulseWeave for run-local
  coalescing and bounded work-in-progress, and capillary windows for small typed
  source/preparation/sink work units only where the bottleneck shape justifies those controls.
- There are no current direct open implementation items. Reopen completed `PERF-DESIGN-*` or
  `PERF-DESIGN-*R` passes only with new current artifact, validator, CI, UAT simulation, or
  maintainer-review evidence.

### Global Architecture Review Carry-Forward

- Runtime gap-family burn-down and validator mapping still own historical/global references:
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6E` automatic dynamic preparation,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6F` output/fanout conversion,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-4R/5O` effectful-operation local fixture/admission closeout,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-4D/5G` expression/operator closeout plus `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-4D-F1`,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-4D-F2` complex dtype,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-4D-F3` advanced predicate/subquery, `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6A`, and closed 6D
  runtime breadth families.
- Phase strings retained for routing and validator compatibility:
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6D:last_order.broad_sql_grammar`,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6D:last_order.python_dataframe_api_breadth`,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6A compute-engine completion gate and residual blocker burn-down`,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6D:last_order.object_store_lakehouse_runtime`,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6D:last_order.generated_output_platform_runtime`,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6D:last_order.front_door_performance_benchmark_publication`,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6D:last_order.effectful_operations`,
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6D:last_order.live_hybrid_runtime`, and
  `GAR-RUNTIME-IMPL-6D:last_order.distributed_spill_oom_runtime`.

### Guardrails

- No Spark, DataFusion, DuckDB, Polars, Velox, Trino, Dask, Ray, pandas, PyArrow, or another engine
  may execute unsupported ShardLoom work as fallback.
- Vortex is the highest-fidelity native input/output target.
- Compatibility inputs and outputs are explicit translation/admission surfaces, not execution
  fallback.
- Unsupported behavior must fail explicitly with deterministic diagnostics.
- Do not make performance, production, package, Spark-displacement, superiority, object-store,
  Foundry, REST, live/hybrid, SQL/DataFrame, or public release claims without the required
  workload-scoped evidence and approval gates.
- Benchmark route analysis must group by `(route_lane_id, timing_surface)` and honor
  `route_timing_stage_inclusion_classes`; diagnostic stage fields must not silently redefine hot
  runtime totals.

## Completed

Detailed completed session and historical phase ledgers live in
`docs/architecture/phased-execution-completed-ledger.md`.

Keep this section as a pointer only so this file remains the compact autonomous Planned queue. After
a session or merge completes, add the detailed completed block to the ledger file, not below this
pointer.
